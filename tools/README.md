# Jupyter Dev environment

This folder contains two scripts (one for Windows and one for Linux and Mac) that will set-up a virtual environment containing Jupyter, Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Book and minimal set of other tools for development.
Running this script first time will create the environment in the `.venv` dir in the repo root folder, activate it and install all needed packages into, then run Jupyter for you. 
Running it subsequently will just start Jupyter.
